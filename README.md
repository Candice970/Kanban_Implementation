### Customization Choices
Our Automated Kanban board for the Smart Inventory Management System was customized to align with Agile principles and improve workflow tracking. Below are the key customization choices made:

- Added 'Testing' Column: Ensures features are verified before being marked as complete, aligning with QA requirements.
- Added 'Blocked' Column: Identifies issues that need resolution before progressing, improving visibility into project obstacles.
- Mapped User Stories to Kanban Board: Each user story is assigned a status, ensuring transparency in task progress.
- Used Automation for Status Updates: Issues move automatically based on updates, reducing manual tracking efforts.
