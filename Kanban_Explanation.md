## Kanban Explanation

### What is a Kanban Board?
A Kanban board is a visual project management tool that tracks tasks across different workflow stages. It helps teams visualize progress, manage workloads, and optimize efficiency.

### How Our Kanban Board Works
1. **Visualizing Workflow:** Columns represent stages such as *New*, *In Progress*, *Review*, *Testing*, *Blocked*, and *Done*.
2. **Limiting Work in Progress (WIP):** Each stage has a limit to prevent overload, ensuring focus and efficiency.
3. **Supporting Agile Principles:** Continuous updates, automation, and flexibility enable smooth iterative development.

## Reflection
# Challenges in Selecting and Customizing the Template
- Understanding the differences between templates took time.
- Ensuring the board aligns with Agile principles required customization.
- Assigning tasks appropriately based on team roles.

### Comparison with Other Tools
- **GitHub Projects** integrates well with repositories but has fewer customization options than **Jira**.
- **Trello** is more user-friendly but lacks GitHubâ€™s deep integration with development workflows.
- **Jira** is powerful for Agile but requires more setup and learning.
